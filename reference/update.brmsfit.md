# Update brms models

This method allows to update an existing `brmsfit` object.

## Usage

``` r
# S3 method for class 'brmsfit'
update(object, formula., newdata = NULL, recompile = NULL, ...)
```

## Arguments

- object:

  An object of class `brmsfit`.

- formula.:

  Changes to the formula; for details see
  [`update.formula`](https://rdrr.io/r/stats/update.formula.html) and
  [`brmsformula`](https://paulbuerkner.com/brms/reference/brmsformula.md).

- newdata:

  Optional `data.frame` to update the model with new data.
  Data-dependent default priors will not be updated automatically.

- recompile:

  Logical, indicating whether the Stan model should be recompiled. If
  `NULL` (the default), `update` tries to figure out internally, if
  recompilation is necessary. Setting it to `FALSE` will cause all Stan
  code changing arguments to be ignored.

- ...:

  Other arguments passed to
  [`brm`](https://paulbuerkner.com/brms/reference/brm.md).

## Details

When updating a `brmsfit` created with the cmdstanr backend in a
different R session, a recompilation will be triggered because by
default, cmdstanr writes the model executable to a temporary directory.
To avoid that, set option `"cmdstanr_write_stan_file_dir"` to a
nontemporary path of your choice before creating the original `brmsfit`
(see section 'Examples' below).

## Examples

``` r
# \dontrun{
fit1 <- brm(time | cens(censored) ~ age * sex + disease + (1|patient),
            data = kidney, family = gaussian("log"))
