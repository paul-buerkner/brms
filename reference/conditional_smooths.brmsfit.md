# Display Smooth Terms

Display smooth `s` and `t2` terms of models fitted with brms.

## Usage

``` r
# S3 method for class 'brmsfit'
conditional_smooths(
  x,
  smooths = NULL,
  int_conditions = NULL,
  prob = 0.95,
  spaghetti = FALSE,
  surface = TRUE,
  resolution = 100,
  too_far = 0,
  ndraws = NULL,
  draw_ids = NULL,
  nsamples = NULL,
  subset = NULL,
  probs = NULL,
  ...
)

conditional_smooths(x, ...)
```

## Arguments

- x:

  An object of class `brmsfit`.

- smooths:

  Optional character vector of smooth terms to display. If `NULL` (the
  default) all smooth terms are shown.

- int_conditions:

  An optional named `list` whose elements are vectors of values of the
  variables specified in `effects`. At these values, predictions are
  evaluated. The names of `int_conditions` have to match the variable
  names exactly. Additionally, the elements of the vectors may be named
  themselves, in which case their names appear as labels for the
  conditions in the plots. Instead of vectors, functions returning
  vectors may be passed and are applied on the original values of the
  corresponding variable. If `NULL` (the default), predictions are
  evaluated at the \\mean\\ and at \\mean +/- sd\\ for numeric
  predictors and at all categories for factor-like predictors.

- prob:

  A value between 0 and 1 indicating the desired probability to be
  covered by the uncertainty intervals. The default is 0.95.

- spaghetti:

  Logical. Indicates if predictions should be visualized via spaghetti
  plots. Only applied for numeric predictors. If `TRUE`, it is
  recommended to set argument `ndraws` to a relatively small value
  (e.g., `100`) in order to reduce computation time.

- surface:

  Logical. Indicates if interactions or two-dimensional smooths should
  be visualized as a surface. Defaults to `TRUE`. The surface type can
  be controlled via argument `stype` of the related plotting method.

- resolution:

  Number of support points used to generate the plots. Higher resolution
  leads to smoother plots. Defaults to `100`. If `surface` is `TRUE`,
  this implies `10000` support points for interaction terms, so it might
  be necessary to reduce `resolution` when only few RAM is available.

- too_far:

  Positive number. For surface plots only: Grid points that are too far
  away from the actual data points can be excluded from the plot.
  `too_far` determines what is too far. The grid is scaled into the unit
  square and then grid points more than `too_far` from the predictor
  variables are excluded. By default, all grid points are used. Ignored
  for non-surface plots.

- ndraws:

  Positive integer indicating how many posterior draws should be used.
  If `NULL` (the default) all draws are used. Ignored if `draw_ids` is
  not `NULL`.

- draw_ids:

  An integer vector specifying the posterior draws to be used. If `NULL`
  (the default), all draws are used.

- nsamples:

  Deprecated alias of `ndraws`.

- subset:

  Deprecated alias of `draw_ids`.

- probs:

  (Deprecated) The quantiles to be used in the computation of
  uncertainty intervals. Please use argument `prob` instead.

- ...:

  Currently ignored.

## Value

For the `brmsfit` method, an object of class `brms_conditional_effects`.
See
[`conditional_effects`](https://paulbuerkner.com/brms/reference/conditional_effects.brmsfit.md)
for more details and documentation of the related plotting function.

## Details

Two-dimensional smooth terms will be visualized using either contour or
raster plots.
