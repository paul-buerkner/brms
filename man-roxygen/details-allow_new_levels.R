#' @details
#' In multilevel models, it is possible to
#' allow new levels of grouping factors to be used in the predictions.
#' This can be controlled via argument \code{allow_new_levels}.
#' New levels can be sampled in multiple ways, which can be controlled
#' via argument \code{sample_new_levels}. Both of these arguments are
#' documented in \code{\link{prepare_predictions}} along with several
#' other useful arguments to control specific aspects of the predictions.
