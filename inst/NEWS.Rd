  \subsection{NEW FEATURES}{
    \itemize{ 
      \item Add support for generalized additive mixed models
      (GAMMs). Smoothing terms can be specified using
      the \code{s} and \code{t2} functions in the model formula.
      \item Introduce the \code{pp_check} method for \code{brmsfit} 
      objects to perform various posterior predictive checks

  \subsection{OTHER CHANGES}{

      \item The \code{gaussian("log")} family no longer implies
      a log-normal distribution, but a normal distribution with

      The log-normal distribution can now be specified via
      family \code{lognormal}.
      \item The \code{plot} and \code{pairs} methods of
      \code{brmsfit} objects now internally use the 
      \code{bayesplot} package.
    }
  }
  \subsection{BUG FIXES}{
    \itemize{ 
      \item The \code{ngrps} method should now always
      return the correct result for non-linear models.

      models using the reserved variable \code{intercept}
      thanks to Frederik Aust.

    }
  }
}  

\section{CHANGES IN VERSION 0.9.1}{
  \subsection{NEW FEATURES}{
    \itemize{ 
      \item Allow the '/' symbol in group-level terms in 
      the \code{formula} argument to indicate nested 
      grouping structures.
      \item Allow to compute \code{WAIC} and \code{LOO}
      based on the pointwise log-likelihood using argument

      message when changing some parts of the model 
      \code{formula} using the \code{update} method.

}

\section{CHANGES IN VERSION 0.9.0}{
  \subsection{NEW FEATURES}{
    \itemize{ 
      \item Add support for \code{monotonic} effects
      allowing to use ordinal predictors without 
      assuming their categories to be equidistant.
      \item Apply multivariate formula syntax in categorical 
      models to considerably increase modeling flexibility. 
      \item Add the addition argument \code{disp} to define 
      multiplicative factors on dispersion parameters. 
      For linear models, \code{disp} applies to the residual
      standard deviation \code{sigma} so that it can be
      used to weight observations.
      \item Treat the fixed effects design matrix as sparse
      by using the \code{sparse} argument of \code{brm}. 
      This can considerably reduce working memory

      allow for fixed user-defined covariance matrices of the 
      response variable.

      \item Extend the functionality of the \code{update} 
      method to allow all model parts to be updated.
      \item Center the fixed effects design matrix also 
      in multivariate models. This may lead to increased
      sampling speed in models with many predictors.

  }
  \subsection{OTHER CHANGES}{
    \itemize{
      \item Refactor \pkg{Stan} code and data generating

      the \code{marginal_effects} method are always smooth.
      \item Allow to define category specific effects in
      ordinal models directly within the \code{formula}
      argument.
    }
  }

      grouping factors in non-linear models thanks to
      Tom Wallis.
      \item Fix a bug in the linear predictor computation
      within \code{R}, occuring for ordinal models 
      with multiple category specific effects. This
      could lead to incorrect outputs of \code{predict},
      \code{fitted}, and \code{logLik} for these models.
      \item Make sure that the global \code{"contrasts"} option 
      is not used when post-processing a model.

      argument in \code{brm}.
      \item Compute and plot marginal effects using the
      \code{marginal_effects} method thanks to the help 
      of Ruben Arslan.
      \item Implement zero-inflated beta models through
      family \code{zero_inflated_beta} thanks to the 
      idea of Ali Roshan Ghias.
      \item Allow to restrict domain of fixed effects and
      autocorrelation parameters using new arguments 
      \code{lb} and \code{ub} in function \code{set_prior}
      thanks to the idea of Joel Gombin.
      \item Add an \code{as.mcmc} method for compatibility 
      with the \pkg{coda} package.
      \item Allow to call the \code{WAIC}, \code{LOO}, 
      and \code{logLik} methods with new data.
    }
  }
  \subsection{OTHER CHANGES}{
    \itemize{
      \item Make sure that \pkg{brms} is fully compatible 
      with \pkg{loo} version 0.1.5.
      \item Optionally define the intercept
      as an ordinary fixed effect to avoid the
      reparametrization via centering of the
      fixed effects design matrix.
      \item Do not compute the WAIC in \code{summary}
      by default anymore to reduce computation time
      of the method for larger models.
      \item The \code{cauchy} family is now deprecated 
      and will be removed soon as it often has convergence 
      issues and not much practical application anyway.
      \item Change the default settings of the number of 
      chains and warmup samples to the defaults of \pkg{rstan}
      (i.e., \code{chains = 4} and \code{warmup = iter / 2}).
      \item Do not remove bad behaving chains anymore as
      they may point to general convergence problems that 
      are dangerous to ignore.
      \item Improve flexibility of the \code{theme} argument
      in all plotting functions.
      \item Only show the legend once per page, when computing
      trace and density plots with the \code{plot} method.
      \item Move code of self-defined \pkg{Stan} functions
      to \code{inst/chunks} and incorporate them into the
      models using \code{rstan::stanc_builder}.
      Also, add unit tests for these functions.

      not just the first one.
      \item Fix a bug in the log-likelihood computation of
      \code{hurdle_poisson} and \code{hurdle_negbinomial} models.
      This may lead to minor changes in the values obtained by
      \code{WAIC} and \code{LOO} for these models.
      \item Fix some backwards compatibility issues of models fitted 
      with version <= 0.5.0 thanks to Ulf Koether.

      \item Improve evaluation of the response
      part of the \code{formula} argument to
      reliably allow terms with more than one variable

      of \code{(random || group)} terms in \code{formula}
      thanks to Ali Roshan Ghias.
      \item Utilize user-defined functions in the \pkg{Stan} code 
      of ordinal models to improve readability as well as
      sampling efficiency.
      \item Make sure that model comparisons using \code{LOO} 
      or \code{WAIC} are only performed when models are 
      based on the same responses.
      \item Use some generic functions of the \pkg{lme4}
      package to avoid unnecessary function masking. This 
      leads to a change in the argument order of
      method \code{VarCorr}.
      \item Change the \code{ggplot} theme in the
      \code{plot} method through argument \code{theme}.
      \item Remove the \code{n.} prefix in arguments

      moving-average effects and non-identity link functions 
      so that they no longer contain code related solely 
      to autoregressive effects.

      could cause complicated random effects terms to be 
      falsely treated as fixed effects.
      \item Fix several bugs when calling the \code{fitted} 
      and \code{predict} methods with \code{newdata} thanks
      to Ali Roshan Ghias.

  \subsection{NEW FEATURES}{
    \itemize{
      \item New S3 class \code{brmsfit} to be returned by 
      the \code{brm} function.
      \item New methods for class \code{brmsfit}: 
      \code{summary}, \code{print}, \code{plot}, \code{predict}, 
      \code{fixef}, \code{ranef}, \code{VarCorr}, 
      \code{nobs}, \code{ngrps}, and \code{formula}.
      \item Introduce new argument \code{silent} in the 
      \code{brm} function, allowing to suppress most of 
      \pkg{Stan}'s intermediate output.
      \item Introduce new families \code{negbinomial} (negative binomial) 
      and \code{geometric} to allow for more flexibility 
      in modeling count data.
    }

    \itemize{
      \item Fix a bug that caused problems when formulas contained 
      more complicated function calls.
      \item Fix a bug that caused an error when posterior predictives were 
      sampled for family \code{cumulative}
      \item Fix a bug that prohibited to use of improper flat priors 
      for parameters that have proper priors by default.
