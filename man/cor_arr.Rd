\title{(Defunct) ARR correlation structure}
\usage{
cor_arr(formula = ~1, r = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{formula}{A one sided formula of the form \code{~ t}, or \code{~ t | g},
specifying a time covariate \code{t} and, optionally, a grouping factor
\code{g}. A covariate for this correlation structure must be integer
valued. When a grouping factor is present in \code{formula}, the
correlation structure is assumed to apply only to observations within the
same grouping level; observations with different grouping levels are
assumed to be uncorrelated. Defaults to \code{~ 1}, which corresponds to
using the order of the observations in the data as a covariate, and no
groups.}

\item{r}{No longer supported.}
