\title{Realize a brm Call from Preview}
\usage{
realize(x, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{An object of class `brm_call_preview`, typically returned by calling `brm(..., preview = TRUE)`.}

\item{...}{Optional arguments to override or supplement the original call. These arguments
will be merged into the original call before evaluation.}
}
\value{
The result of the evaluated `brm()` call (typically a `brmsfit` object).
}
\description{
Converts a `brm_call_preview` object created by `brm(..., preview = TRUE)` into a full model fit.
This function evaluates the original call with `preview = FALSE`, allowing the user to "realize" the model
when they are ready to run it for real.
}
\details{
This function is useful in interactive workflows or debugging sessions where you first want
to preview what a model call would look like, and then later decide to run it. It ensures
that `preview = FALSE` is set in the final call. Additional parameters can be supplied
to change or extend the original model fitting request.

\examples{
\dontrun{
# Preview model setup
preview_obj <- brm(
  count ~ zAge + zBase * Trt + (1|patient),
  data = epilepsy, family = poisson(), preview = TRUE
)

# Realize the full model fit
fit <- realize(preview_obj)

# Override any parameter from the original call if needed
fit2 <- realize(preview_obj, family = gaussian())
}
