\title{Model Weighting Methods}
\usage{
\method{model_weights}{brmsfit}(x, ..., weights = "stacking", model_names = NULL)

model_weights(x, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A \code{brmsfit} object.}

\item{...}{More \code{brmsfit} objects or further arguments
passed to the underlying post-processing functions.
In particular, see \code{\link{prepare_predictions}} for further
supported arguments.}

\item{weights}{Name of the criterion to compute weights from. Should be one
of \code{"loo"}, \code{"waic"}, \code{"kfold"}, \code{"stacking"} (current
default), or \code{"bma"}, \code{"pseudobma"}, For the former three
options, Akaike weights will be computed based on the information criterion
values returned by the respective methods. For \code{"stacking"} and
\code{"pseudobma"}, method \code{\link{loo_model_weights}} will be used to
obtain weights. For \code{"bma"}, method \code{\link{post_prob}} will be
used to compute Bayesian model averaging weights based on log marginal
likelihood values (make sure to specify reasonable priors in this case).
For some methods, \code{weights} may also be a numeric vector of
pre-specified weights.}

\item{model_names}{If \code{NULL} (the default) will use model names
derived from deparsing the call. Otherwise will use the passed
values as model names.}
}
\value{
A numeric vector of weights for the models.
}
\description{
Compute model weights in various ways, for instance, via
stacking of posterior predictive distributions, Akaike weights,
or marginal likelihoods.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# model with 'treat' as predictor
fit1 <- brm(rating ~ treat + period + carry, data = inhaler)
summary(fit1)

# model without 'treat' as predictor
fit2 <- brm(rating ~ period + carry, data = inhaler)
summary(fit2)

# obtain Akaike weights based on the WAIC
model_weights(fit1, fit2, weights = "waic")
}
