The \pkg{brms} package provides an interface to fit Bayesian generalized
multivariate (non-)linear multilevel models using \pkg{Stan}, which is a C++
package for obtaining full Bayesian inference (see
\url{https://mc-stan.org/}). The formula syntax is an extended version of the
syntax applied in the \pkg{lme4} package to provide a familiar and simple
interface for performing regression analyses.
}
\details{
The main function of \pkg{brms} is \code{\link{brm}}, which uses
formula syntax to specify a wide range of complex Bayesian models
(see \code{\link{brmsformula}} for details). Based on the supplied
formulas, data, and additional information, it writes the Stan code
on the fly via \code{\link[brms:stancode.default]{stancode}}, prepares the data via
\code{\link[brms:standata.default]{standata}} and fits the model using
\pkg{\link[rstan:rstan]{Stan}}.

Subsequently, a large number of post-processing methods can be applied:
To get an overview on the estimated parameters,
\code{\link[brms:summary.brmsfit]{summary}} or
\code{\link[brms:conditional_effects.brmsfit]{conditional_effects}}
are perfectly suited. Detailed visual analyses can be performed by applying
the \code{\link{pp_check}} and \code{\link{stanplot}} methods, which both
rely on the \pkg{\link[bayesplot:bayesplot-package]{bayesplot}} package.
Model comparisons can be done via \code{\link{loo}} and \code{\link{waic}},
which make use of the \pkg{\link[loo:loo-package]{loo}} package as well as
via \code{\link{bayes_factor}} which relies on the \pkg{bridgesampling} package.
For a full list of methods to apply, type \code{methods(class = "brmsfit")}.

Because \pkg{brms} is based on \pkg{Stan}, a C++ compiler is required. The
program Rtools (available on
\url{https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/}) comes with a C++
compiler for Windows. On Mac, you should use Xcode. For further instructions
on how to get the compilers running, see the prerequisites section at the
\href{https://github.com/stan-dev/rstan/wiki/RStan-Getting-Started}{RStan-Getting-Started}
page.

When comparing other packages fitting multilevel models to \pkg{brms}, keep
in mind that the latter needs to compile models before actually fitting them,
which will require between 20 and 40 seconds depending on your machine,
operating system and overall model complexity.

Thus, fitting smaller models may be relatively slow as compilation time makes
up the majority of the whole running time. For larger / more complex
models however, fitting my take several minutes or even hours, so that the
compilation time won't make much of a difference for these models.

See \code{vignette("brms_overview")} and \code{vignette("brms_multilevel")}
for a general introduction and overview of \pkg{brms}. For a full list of
available vignettes, type \code{vignette(package = "brms")}.
