\title{Compute the LOO information criterion}
\usage{
\method{LOO}{brmsfit}(x, ..., compare = TRUE, resp = NULL,
  pointwise = NULL, reloo = FALSE, k_threshold = 0.7,
  model_names = NULL)

LOO(x, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A fitted model object.}

\item{...}{More fitted model objects or further arguments
passed to the underlying post-processing functions.}

\item{compare}{A flag indicating if the information criteria
of the models should be compared to each other
via \code{\link{compare_ic}}.}

\item{resp}{Optional names of response variables.
If specified, fitted values of these response variables are returned.}

\item{pointwise}{A flag indicating whether to compute the full
log-likelihood matrix at once or separately for each observation. 
The latter approach is usually considerably slower but 
requires much less working memory. Accordingly, if one runs 
into memory issues, \code{pointwise = TRUE} is the way to go.
By default, \code{pointwise} is automatically chosen based on 
the size of the model.}

\item{reloo}{Logical; Indicate whether \code{\link{reloo}} 
should be applied on problematic observations. Defaults to \code{FALSE}.}

\item{k_threshold}{The threshold at which pareto \eqn{k} 
estimates are treated as problematic. Defaults to \code{0.7}. 
Only used if argument \code{reloo} is \code{TRUE}.
See \code{\link[loo:pareto_k_ids]{pareto_k_ids}} for more details.}

\item{model_names}{If \code{NULL} (the default) will use model names 
derived from deparsing the call. Otherwise will use the passed 
values as model names.}
}
\value{
If just one object is provided, an object of class \code{ic}. 
 If multiple objects are provided, an object of class \code{iclist}.
}
\description{
Perform approximate leave-one-out cross-validation based 
on the posterior likelihood using the \pkg{loo} package.
}
\details{
When comparing models fitted to the same data, 
 the smaller the LOO, the better the fit.
 For \code{brmsfit} objects, \code{loo} is an alias of \code{LOO}.
 Use method \code{\link{add_ic}} to store
 information criteria in the fitted model object for later usage.
