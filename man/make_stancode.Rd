\arguments{
\item{formula}{An object of class \code{\link[stats:formula]{formula}},
\code{\link{brmsformula}}, or \code{\link{mvbrmsformula}} (or one that can
be coerced to that classes): A symbolic description of the model to be
fitted. The details of model specification are explained in
\code{\link{brmsformula}}.}

\item{data}{An object of class \code{data.frame} (or one that can be coerced
to that class) containing data of all variables used in the model.}

\item{family}{A description of the response distribution and link function to
be used in the model. This can be a family function, a call to a family
function or a character string naming the family. Every family function has
a \code{link} argument allowing to specify the link function to be applied
on the response variable. If not specified, default links are used. For
details of supported families see \code{\link{brmsfamily}}. By default, a
linear \code{gaussian} model is applied. In multivariate models,
\code{family} might also be a list of families.}

\item{prior}{One or more \code{brmsprior} objects created by
\code{\link{set_prior}} or related functions and combined using the
\code{c} method or the \code{+} operator. See also  \code{\link{get_prior}}
for more help.}

\item{autocor}{(Deprecated) An optional \code{\link{cor_brms}} object
describing the correlation structure within the response variable (i.e.,
the 'autocorrelation'). See the documentation of \code{\link{cor_brms}} for
a description of the available correlation structures. Defaults to
\code{NULL}, corresponding to no correlations. In multivariate models,
\code{autocor} might also be a list of autocorrelation structures.
It is now recommend to specify autocorrelation terms directly
within \code{formula}. See \code{\link{brmsformula}} for more details.}

\item{data2}{A named \code{list} of objects containing data, which
cannot be passed via argument \code{data}. Required for some objects
used in autocorrelation structures to specify dependency structures
as well as for within-group covariance matrices.}

\item{cov_ranef}{(Deprecated) A list of matrices that are proportional to the
(within) covariance structure of the group-level effects. The names of the
matrices should correspond to columns in \code{data} that are used as
grouping factors. All levels of the grouping factor should appear as
rownames of the corresponding matrix. This argument can be used, among
others to model pedigrees and phylogenetic effects.
It is now recommended to specify those matrices in the formula
interface using the \code{\link{gr}} and related functions. See
\code{vignette("brms_phylogenetics")} for more details.}

\item{sparse}{(Deprecated) Logical; indicates whether the population-level
design matrices should be treated as sparse (defaults to \code{FALSE}). For
design matrices with many zeros, this can considerably reduce required
memory. Sampling speed is currently not improved or even slightly
decreased. It is now recommended to use the \code{sparse} argument of
\code{\link{brmsformula}} and related functions.}

\item{sample_prior}{Indicate if draws from priors should be drawn
additionally to the posterior draws. Options are \code{"no"} (the
default), \code{"yes"}, and \code{"only"}. Among others, these draws can
be used to calculate Bayes factors for point hypotheses via
\code{\link{hypothesis}}. Please note that improper priors are not sampled,
including the default improper priors used by \code{brm}. See
\code{\link{set_prior}} on how to set (proper) priors. Please also note
that prior draws for the overall intercept are not obtained by default
for technical reasons. See \code{\link{brmsformula}} how to obtain prior
draws for the intercept. If \code{sample_prior} is set to \code{"only"},
draws are drawn solely from the priors ignoring the likelihood, which
allows among others to generate draws from the prior predictive
distribution. In this case, all parameters must have proper priors.}

\item{stanvars}{An optional \code{stanvars} object generated by function
\code{\link{stanvar}} to define additional variables for use in
\pkg{Stan}'s program blocks.}

\item{stan_funs}{(Deprecated) An optional character string containing
self-defined  \pkg{Stan} functions, which will be included in the functions
block of the generated \pkg{Stan} code. It is now recommended to use the
\code{stanvars} argument for this purpose instead.}

\item{knots}{Optional list containing user specified knot values to be used
for basis construction of smoothing terms. See
\code{\link[mgcv:gamm]{gamm}} for more details.}

\item{drop_unused_levels}{Should unused factors levels in the data be
dropped? Defaults to \code{TRUE}.}

\item{threads}{Number of threads to use in within-chain parallelization. For
more control over the threading process, \code{threads} may also be a
\code{brmsthreads} object created by \code{\link{threading}}. Within-chain
parallelization is experimental! We recommend its use only if you are
experienced with Stan's \code{reduce_sum} function and have a slow running
model that cannot be sped up by any other means. Can be set globally for
the current \R session via the \code{"brms.threads"} option (see
\code{\link{options}}).}

\item{normalize}{Logical. Indicates whether normalization constants should
be included in the Stan code (defaults to \code{TRUE}). Setting it
to \code{FALSE} requires Stan version >= 2.25 to work. If \code{FALSE},
sampling efficiency may be increased but some post processing functions
such as \code{\link{bridge_sampler}} will not be available. Can be
controlled globally for the current \R session via the `brms.normalize`
option.}

\item{save_model}{Either \code{NULL} or a character string. In the latter
case, the model's Stan code is saved via \code{\link{cat}} in a text file
named after the string supplied in \code{save_model}.}

\item{...}{Other arguments for internal usage only.}
