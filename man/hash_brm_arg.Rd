\title{Class-aware hashing for individual brm() arguments}
\usage{
hash_brm_arg(x, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A single argument from a brm() call.}

\item{...}{Passed on to class-specific methods (e.g. \code{algo},
\code{threshold}).}
}
\value{
A character scalar hash.
}
\description{
Dispatches to methods that normalise and hash each argument according to
its class (formula, family, data.frame, â€¦).  All methods ultimately call
\code{digest::digest()}, but strip environments and reorder components so
that equivalent inputs produce identical hashes.
