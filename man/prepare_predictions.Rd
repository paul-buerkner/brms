\arguments{
\item{x}{An \R object typically of class \code{'brmsfit'}.}

\item{newdata}{An optional data.frame for which to evaluate predictions. If
\code{NULL} (default), the original data of the model is used.
\code{NA} values within factors are interpreted as if all dummy
variables of this factor are zero. This allows, for instance, to make
predictions of the grand mean when using sum coding.}

\item{re_formula}{formula containing group-level effects to be considered in
the prediction. If \code{NULL} (default), include all group-level effects;
if \code{NA}, include no group-level effects.}

\item{allow_new_levels}{A flag indicating if new levels of group-level
effects are allowed (defaults to \code{FALSE}). Only relevant if
\code{newdata} is provided.}

\item{sample_new_levels}{Indicates how to sample new levels for grouping
factors specified in \code{re_formula}. This argument is only relevant if
\code{newdata} is provided and \code{allow_new_levels} is set to
\code{TRUE}. If \code{"uncertainty"} (default), each posterior sample for a
new level is drawn from the posterior draws of a randomly chosen existing
level. Each posterior sample for a new level may be drawn from a different
existing level such that the resulting set of new posterior draws
represents the variation across existing levels. If \code{"gaussian"},
sample new levels from the (multivariate) normal distribution implied by the
group-level standard deviations and correlations. This options may be useful
for conducting Bayesian power analysis or predicting new levels in
situations where relatively few levels where observed in the old_data. If
\code{"old_levels"}, directly sample new levels from the existing levels,
where a new level is assigned all of the posterior draws of the same
(randomly chosen) existing level.}

\item{incl_autocor}{A flag indicating if correlation structures originally
specified via \code{autocor} should be included in the predictions.
Defaults to \code{TRUE}.}

\item{oos}{Optional indices of observations for which to compute
out-of-sample rather than in-sample predictions. Only required in models
that make use of response values to make predictions, that is, currently
only ARMA models.}

\item{resp}{Optional names of response variables. If specified, predictions
are performed only for the specified response variables.}

\item{ndraws}{Positive integer indicating how many posterior draws should
be used. If \code{NULL} (the default) all draws are used. Ignored if
\code{draw_ids} is not \code{NULL}.}

\item{draw_ids}{An integer vector specifying the posterior draws to be used.
If \code{NULL} (the default), all draws are used.}

\item{nsamples}{Deprecated alias of \code{ndraws}.}

\item{subset}{Deprecated alias of \code{draw_ids}.}

\item{nug}{Small positive number for Gaussian process terms only. For
numerical reasons, the covariance matrix of a Gaussian process might not be
positive definite. Adding a very small number to the matrix's diagonal
often solves this problem. If \code{NULL} (the default), \code{nug} is
chosen internally.}

\item{smooths_only}{Logical; If \code{TRUE} only predictions related to the}

\item{offset}{Logical; Indicates if offsets should be included in the
predictions. Defaults to \code{TRUE}.}

\item{newdata2}{A named \code{list} of objects containing new data, which
cannot be passed via argument \code{newdata}. Required for some objects
used in autocorrelation structures, or \code{\link{stanvars}}.}

\item{new_objects}{Deprecated alias of \code{newdata2}.}

\item{point_estimate}{Shall the returned object contain only point estimates
of the parameters instead of their posterior draws? Defaults to
\code{NULL} in which case no point estimate is computed. Alternatively, may
be set to \code{"mean"} or \code{"median"}. This argument is primarily
implemented to ensure compatibility with the \code{\link{loo_subsample}}
method.}

\item{ndraws_point_estimate}{Only used if \code{point_estimate} is not
\code{NULL}. How often shall the point estimate's value be repeated?
Defaults to \code{1}.}

\item{...}{Further arguments passed to \code{\link{validate_newdata}}.}
}
\value{
An object of class \code{'brmsprep'} or \code{'mvbrmsprep'},
  depending on whether a univariate or multivariate model is passed.
}
\description{
This method helps in preparing \pkg{brms} models for certin post-processing
tasks most notably various forms of predictions. Unless you are a package
developer, you will rarely need to call \code{prepare_predictions} directly.
