\usage{
\method{coef}{brmsfit}(object, summary = TRUE, robust = FALSE, probs = c(0.025, 0.975), ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{An object of class \code{brmsfit}.}

\item{summary}{Should summary statistics be returned
instead of the raw values? Default is \code{TRUE}.}

\item{robust}{If \code{FALSE} (the default) the mean is used as
the measure of central tendency and the standard deviation as
the measure of variability. If \code{TRUE}, the median and the
median absolute deviation (MAD) are applied instead.
Only used if \code{summary} is \code{TRUE}.}

\item{probs}{The percentiles to be computed by the \code{quantile}
function. Only used if \code{summary} is \code{TRUE}.}

\item{...}{Further arguments passed to \code{\link{fixef.brmsfit}}
and \code{\link{ranef.brmsfit}}.}
}
\value{
A list of 3D arrays (one per grouping factor).
 If \code{summary} is \code{TRUE},
 the 1st dimension contains the factor levels,
 the 2nd dimension contains the summary statistics
 (see \code{\link{posterior_summary}}), and
 the 3rd dimension contains the group-level effects.
 If \code{summary} is \code{FALSE}, the 1st dimension contains
 the posterior draws, the 2nd dimension contains the factor levels,
 and the 3rd dimension contains the group-level effects.
}
\description{
Extract model coefficients, which are the sum of population-level
effects and corresponding group-level effects
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
fit <- brm(count ~ zAge + zBase * Trt + (1+Trt|visit),
           data = epilepsy, family = gaussian(), chains = 2)
## extract population and group-level coefficients separately
fixef(fit)
ranef(fit)
## extract combined coefficients
coef(fit)
}
