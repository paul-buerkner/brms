Description: Fit Bayesian generalized (non-)linear multilevel models 
    using Stan for full Bayesian inference. A wide range of distributions 
    and link functions are supported, allowing users to fit
    linear, robust linear, binomial, Poisson, survival, response times, ordinal, 
    zero-inflated, hurdle, and even non-linear models all in a multilevel context. 
    Further modeling options include auto-correlation and smoothing terms, 
    user defined dependence structures, censored data, meta-analytic 
    standard errors, and quite a few more. 
    In addition, all parameters of the response distribution can be predicted
    in order to perform distributional regression.
    Prior specifications are flexible and explicitly encourage 
    users to apply prior distributions that actually reflect their beliefs.
    In addition, model fit can easily be assessed and compared with
    posterior predictive checks and leave-one-out cross-validation.
