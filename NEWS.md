`brms` 1.0 or higher should remain fully compatible with `brms` 2.0.

models may have a different family and autocorrelation structure. Residual
correlations can be estimated for multivariate `gaussian` and `student` models.

# brms 1.0.1
  \subsection{MINOR CHANGES

* Center design matrices inside the Stan code instead of inside `make_standata`.
* Get rid of several warning messages occurring on CRAN.




# brms 1.0.0

This is one of the largest updates of `brms` since its initial release. In
addition to many new features, the multivariate `'trait'` syntax has been
removed from the package as it was confusing for users, required much special
case coding, and was hard to maintain. See `help(brmsformula)` for details of
the formula syntax applied in `brms`.

### Features

* Allow estimating correlations between group-level effects defined across
multiple formulae (e.g., in non-linear models) by specifying IDs in each
grouping term via an extended `lme4` syntax.
* Implement distributional regression models allowing to fully predict auxiliary
parameters of the response distribution. Among many other possibilities, this
can be used to model heterogeneity of variances.
* Zero-inflated and hurdle models do not use multivariate syntax anymore but
instead have special auxiliary parameters named `zi` and `hu` defining
zero-inflation / hurdle probabilities.
* Implement the `von_mises` family to model circular responses.
* Introduce the `brmsfamily` function for convenient specification of `family`
objects.
* Allow predictions of `t2` smoothing terms for new data.
* Feature vectors as arguments for the addition argument `trunc` in order to
model varying truncation points.


### Other changes

* Remove the `cauchy` family after several months of deprecation.
* Make sure that group-level parameter names are unambiguous by adding double
underscores thanks to the idea of the GitHub user schmettow.
* The `predict` method now returns predicted probabilities instead of absolute
frequencies of samples for ordinal and categorical models.
* Compute the linear predictor in the model block of the Stan program instead of
in the transformed parameters block. This avoids saving samples of unnecessary
parameters to disk. Thanks goes to Rick Arrano for pointing me to this issue.
* Colour points in `marginal_effects` plots if sensible.
* Set the default of the `robust` argument to `TRUE` in
`marginal_effects.brmsfit`.


### Bug fixes

* Fix a bug that could occur when predicting factorial response variables for
new data. Only affects categorical and ordinal models.
* Fix a bug that could lead to duplicated variable names in the Stan code when
sampling from priors in non-linear models thanks to Tom Wallis.
* Fix problems when trying to pointwise evaluate non-linear formulae in
`logLik.brmsfit` thanks to Tom Wallis.
* Ensure full compatibility of the `ranef` and `coef` methods with non-linear
models.
* Fix problems that occasionally occurred when handling `dplyr` datasets thanks
to the GitHub user Atan1988.


# brms 0.10.0
### Features

* Add support for generalized additive mixed models (GAMMs). Smoothing terms can
be specified using the `s` and `t2` functions in the model formula.
* Introduce `as.data.frame` and `as.matrix` methods for `brmsfit` objects.

### Other changes

* The `gaussian("log")` family no longer implies a log-normal distribution, but
a normal distribution with log-link to match the behavior of `glm`. The
log-normal distribution can now be specified via family `lognormal`.
* Update syntax of `Stan` models to match the recommended syntax of `Stan` 2.10.


### Bug fixes

* The `ngrps` method should now always return the correct result for non-linear
models.

duplicated and thus invalid row names.

correctly displayed in the output of the `summary` method.

`rstan` >= 2.10.0 installed thanks to the GitHub user cwerner87.


# brms 0.9.1
### Features

indicate nested grouping structures.
* Allow to compute `WAIC` and `LOO` based on the pointwise log-likelihood using

of the model `formula` using the `update` method.

predictors that were generated with the `base::scale` function thanks to Tom
Wallis.

* Add support for `monotonic` effects allowing to use ordinal predictors without
assuming their categories to be equidistant.
* Apply multivariate formula syntax in categorical models to considerably
increase modeling flexibility.
* Add the addition argument `disp` to define multiplicative factors on
dispersion parameters. For linear models, `disp` applies to the residual
standard deviation `sigma` so that it can be used to weight observations.
* Treat the fixed effects design matrix as sparse by using the `sparse` argument
of `brm`. This can considerably reduce working memory requirements if the
predictors contain many zeros.
* Add the `cor_fixed` correlation structure to allow for fixed user-defined
covariance matrices of the response variable.
* Allow to pass self-defined `Stan` functions via argument `stan_funs` of `brm`.
* Add the `expose_functions` method allowing to expose self-defined `Stan`
functions in `R`.
* Extend the functionality of the `update` method to allow all model parts to be
updated.

lead to increased sampling speed in models with many predictors.

easier to extent.
* Improve checks of user-define prior specifications.
* Warn about models that have not converged.

always smooth.

parameters in non-linear models thanks to Emmanuel Charpentier.
* Fix a bug that prohibited to use nested grouping factors in non-linear models
thanks to Tom Wallis.
* Fix a bug in the linear predictor computation within `R`, occurring for ordinal
models with multiple category specific effects. This could lead to incorrect
outputs of `predict`, `fitted`, and `logLik` for these models.
* Make sure that the global `"contrasts"` option is not used when
post-processing a model.

Gombin.

reparametrization via centering of the fixed effects design matrix.
* Do not compute the WAIC in `summary` by default anymore to reduce computation
time of the method for larger models.
* The `cauchy` family is now deprecated and will be removed soon as it often has
convergence issues and not much practical application anyway.
* Change the default settings of the number of chains and warmup samples to the
defaults of `rstan` (i.e., `chains = 4` and `warmup = iter / 2`).
* Do not remove bad behaving chains anymore as they may point to general
convergence problems that are dangerous to ignore.
* Improve flexibility of the `theme` argument in all plotting functions.
* Only show the legend once per page, when computing trace and density plots
with the `plot` method.
* Move code of self-defined `Stan` functions to `inst/chunks` and incorporate
them into the models using `rstan::stanc_builder`. Also, add unit tests for
these functions.


### Bug fixes

* Fix problems when predicting with `newdata` for zero-inflated and hurdle
models thanks to Ruben Arslan.
* Fix problems when predicting with `newdata` if it is a subset of the data
stored in a `brmsfit` object thanks to Ruben Arslan.

that it now always returns the predictions of all response variables, not just
the first one.

`hurdle_negbinomial` models. This may lead to minor changes in the values
obtained by `WAIC` and `LOO` for these models.

Holz-Ebeling.

* Selectively exclude random effects in the `predict`, `fitted`, and `residuals`
methods using argument `re_formula`.
* Add a `plot` method for objects returned by method `hypothesis` to visualize
prior and posterior distributions of the hypotheses being tested.

allow terms with more than one variable (e.g., `y/x ~ 1`).

specified by means of `(random || group)` terms in `formula` thanks to Ali
Roshan Ghias.

readability as well as sampling efficiency.
* Make sure that model comparisons using `LOO` or `WAIC` are only performed when
models are based on the same responses.

masking. This leads to a change in the argument order of method `VarCorr`.

* Remove the `n.` prefix in arguments `n.iter`, `n.warmup`, `n.thin`,
`n.chains`, and `n.cluster` of the `brm` function. The old argument names remain
